A recurrent model of V1 orientation tuning (Teich & Quian 2003) outfitted with a dynamic anti-Hebbian learning mechanism as described in:
Lange, Senden, Radermacher, and De Weerd (submitted). Learning multiple skills reveals competition rather than consolidation.

This repository contains two files.
1. RM.m a MATLAB class implementation of the model.
2. LTI_Experiments.m: a script implementing the experiments reported in the aforementioned study.

This code is hosted at https://github.com/MSenden/LTI
The latest version may always be found here.

This software requires MATLAB R2015a or later. It was developed with access to the full suite of MATLAB add-on packages.
Some of these packages may be required to run the software.
