# Description
A recurrent model of V1 orientation tuning (Teich & Quian 2003) outfitted with a dynamic anti-Hebbian learning mechanism as described in:
Lange, Senden, Radermacher, and De Weerd (submitted). Interfering with a memory without disrupting its trace.

## Abstract
The initiation in one skill can be erased by the initiation in another skill on the same day. It is unknown however whether highly trained skills show the same vulnerability to interference.  To address this question, we trained human participants in one orientation discrimination task for 15 sessions and assessed how performance was affected by subsequent training in another, similar task. As predicted by a neural network learning model of V1, we found strong interference with the highly trained skill, which depended on the relative amounts of training devoted to the different tasks. In our model, interference was due to antagonistic changes in neuronal tuning induced by the two tasks. Remarkably, the interference occurred without overwriting the connections from earlier learning. Hence, even expert skills can be erased by new experiences, but this can result from changes in the context of connections surrounding the unchanged connections set by original learning.
